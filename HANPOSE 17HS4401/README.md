In my opinion, companies should really stop making products with different specs under the same model number, but oh well... This is the 17HS4401 model from HANPOSE, which, compared to the USONGSHINE version, has a marginally lower holding torque at the same current - which I guess makes sense considering it also has a lower phase resistance and thereby fewer turns per coil. On the other hand, this should mean lower inductance and higher maximum speeds... I'm speculating at this point; I really wanted to see the exact differences between these two models in the dynamic torque tests, but I guess that'll have to wait for another day. In any case, there weren't any datasheets available for this motor, but the Alibaba product page lists current and holding torque at least:
