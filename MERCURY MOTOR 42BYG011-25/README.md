This stepper is from Sparkfun and readily available on DigiKey - it also has a very high phase resistance of 34 ohms, which is definitely unusual. I don't know why bipolar motors with this winding configuration are even still manufactured, seeing as the general push has been towards low-resistance, actively current-controlled motors for years now, but I guess there are a few niche applications where having the current regulated passively by good old Ohm's law prevails over modern alternatives by enabling a simple H-bridge drive circuitry to be used.
