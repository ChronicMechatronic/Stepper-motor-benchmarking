### EPSON EM-257/EM-258

These apparently come as a pair in the old Epson Stylus inkjet printers. I was never lucky enough to disassemble one of these printers myself, but based on the gears and pulleys that were on the shaft when I got the motors I'd think the EM-257 was driving the print head while the EM-258 was for the paper feed. Good times when even inkjet printers had NEMA 17s inside...
That said, despite the slightly different naming and physical appearance, from what I could see both these steppers were customized versions of the same motor called 17PM-K212-PIT from Astrosyn at the time, so I simply lumped them together for testing.

There is some ambiguity about the rated current for this motor since the closest thing I found to a datasheet for the 17PM-K212-PIT mentioned 0.6A phase curent, but the old website entry for the EM-258 stated 0.7A, which is what I ultimately went with.
