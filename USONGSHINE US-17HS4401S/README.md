This is the Usongshine-branded version of the seemingly fairly popular 17HS4401. It's set apart from some of its competitors by the slightly lower rated current of 1.5A and higher phase resistance. 
To my knowledge, the only difference between the 17HS4401 and the 17HS4401S version is the painted black endcaps as opposed to the usual cast aluminum look.

There was no official datasheet to be found for this stepper motor; the only specifications I was able to find were on the Aliexpress product page, so I'll include the link for it here:

There's also an exported PDF of the site in case it gets taken down in the future, as well as a detailed CAD model I drew of this motor on thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6761583

(in other words, stating the obvious to make sure I cover my ass for legal purposes here: the fact that I'm sharing screenshots with these logos and graphics in them in a CC-BY-SA-4.0 repository doesn't mean the license extends to those graphics)
