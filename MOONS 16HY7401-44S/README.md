Yet another pancake stepper from MOONS with an annoying brass pulley on it - finding even a picture of a matching unit was impossible, but I managed to find some specs on an ancient derelict website:

 - http://www.huaning.com/oldwebsite/electrical/16hy.htm

Not sure if this is specifically for the MOONS edition of this motor or maybe some other manufacturer's version of it (since I noticed, just like with semiconductors, the more popular models seem to be made by several different companies with very slightly different specs), though seeing as I wasn't able to find anything else whatsoever, it's safe to assume these are the right specs for the stepper.

There's also an exported PDF version of this site as a backup in case somebody remembers to decommission that forgotten-about server in the corner and takes the site down in the future.
