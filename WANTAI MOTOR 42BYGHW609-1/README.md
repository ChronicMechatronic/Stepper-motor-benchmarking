## WANTAI MOTOR 42BYGHW609-1

It's a stepper motor aimed at the 3D printing industry. That's all there is to say about it. Low phase resistance, low inductance, high current - it's all pretty standard stuff. The WANTAI MOTOR website lists the specs:

 - https://www.wantmotor.com/hybrid-stepper-motor/2-phases-hybrid-stepper-motor/42byghw-stepper-motor.html
 - Open Impulse seems to have put together a datasheet for it with even a torque curve added, though at the time of writing this the site didn't manage to load for some reason: https://www.openimpulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/downloadables/42BYGHW609-Stepper-Motor-Datasheet1.pdf

Good news, however, to prepare for exactly that eventuality (a site being taken down or otherwise unavailable), I added the downloaded PDFs to this repository. You're welcome!

Of course, the usual disclaimer still applies; intellectual property rights for any graphics and logos depicted in screenshots of those sites obviously go to their respective site owners and are not part of this open-source repository, as I have no rights to distribute these myself. (in other words, stating the obvious to make sure I cover my ass for legal purposes here: the fact that I'm sharing screenshots with these logos and graphics in them in a CC-BY-SA-4.0 repository doesn't mean the license extends to those graphics)
