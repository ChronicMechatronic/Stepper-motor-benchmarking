## JAPAN SERVO KP35FM2-044

![image of a stepper motor]()

Another stepper motor from JAPAN SERVO - though this one is fortunately bipolar and quite usable in its stock configuration. I was actually able to find two references to this exact model online.

 - A product page for it on some (Serbian?) website: https://www.interhit.rs/razno/12919-mot-kp35fm2-044-2000000137841.html
 - A page of some mail-order-catalog listing the important specs: https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/catalogs/c111/P113.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOor_bC19iC06BBiVbUjoTBsi1h70vK62iOvgwra-4hXkrnkLsA3G

No real datasheets, though unfortunately. I also included exported PDF versions for each of these sites as a backup in case any of them goes down in the future.

Intellectual property rights for any graphics and logos depicted in screenshots of those sites obviously go to their respective site owners and are not part of this open-source repository, as I have no rights to distribute these myself. (in other words, stating the obvious to make sure I cover my ass for legal purposes here: the fact that I'm sharing screenshots with these logos and graphics in them in a CC-BY-SA-4.0 repository doesn't mean the license extends to those graphics)
