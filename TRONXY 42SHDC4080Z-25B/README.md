This stepper motor is clearly from a TRONXY 3D printer, which is why I was all the more surprised by the fact that there was absolutely no info about it online. Ultimately I guess TRONXY just got a custom order of a generic NEMA 17 and slapped their sticker on it with a similar part number to the unit it was cloned from, but with a couple of random letters added for "personalization". So yeah, in other words, it's probably not a real model number; otherwise, it really should've popped up elsewhere in my research. Unfortunately, Tronxy also didn't bother to list any specs anywhere either, as the replacement steppers they sell on their website have a different part number altogether. They're called "SL42STH40" instead, so we're basically on our own if we want specs for the 42SHDC... Or are we? With a bit of _imaginative_ reasoning, we can assume the SL42STH40 steppers they currently sell are simply rebadged generic clones too - what are the odds they actually changed suppliers or specifications? Relatively low, is my gut feeling. Physically they look pretty much identical save for the label, which obviously doesn't say much. So since I needed a baseline current rating for my testing, I decided to just go with the same 1.8A current rating they claim for their current SL42STH motor. Though I honestly don't trust that rating either - if they have no qualms sticking a random model number on steppers, I doubt they'd have a problem driving them at excessive current either. So in continuous use, I would probably run this motor closer to 1.5A or less, depending on how hot it gets. If you happen to have one of these, please run your own tests; even something simple with an A4988 like I did in the video will easily give you a much more reliable reference and prevent anything from being damaged. I just didn't have the time to spend another day letting stepper motors run idle in the basement.

There are also exported PDF versions for some of these sites as a backup in case any of them goes down in the future.
