## KYSAN 1124090 / 42BYGH4803

![image of a stepper motor]()

Apparently this 42BYGH4803 stepper motor was rather common in RepRap 3D printers back in the day. It's from KYSAN with the SKU 1124090, and I really can't think of anything else to say about it. It's a stepper motor, I guess.

Here are the relevant links to product pages listing the specs and datasheets:

Intellectual property rights for any graphics and logos depicted in screenshots of those sites obviously go to their respective site owners and are not part of this open-source repository, as I have no rights to distribute these myself. (in other words, stating the obvious to make sure I cover my ass for legal purposes here: the fact that I'm sharing screenshots with these logos and graphics in them in a CC-BY-SA-4.0 repository doesn't mean the license extends to those graphics)
