I really can't say what device this stepper motor is from - the brass pulley on it is not GT2 size though, so for most DIY projects you'll probably have to remove it, which is more than a little annoying. I recommend a hacksaw to destroy the pulley as the easiest way to get it off - I wanted to keep the motor and the pulley intact, so I had to machine a custom gear puller that actually fit in the tight gap between the motor housing and the pulley flange.

Fortunately, I was able to find what I am relatively confident is the datasheet for this motor - there's even two versions of it:

- https://datasheet4u.com/datasheet-pdf/ETC/17HA0403-44N/pdf.php?id=977470
- http://www.motionusa.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/moons/Hybrid_Stepper_Motors_17HA_Series.pdf

There's also a very similar looking one with a 1.8 step angle instead, though I think it might not be from MOONS - No idea what you might need this for, but here's the link anyway:

There are also exported PDF versions for each of these sites as a backup in case any of them goes down in the future.

Intellectual property rights for any graphics and logos depicted in screenshots of those sites obviously go to their respective site owners and are not part of this open-source repository, as I have no rights to distribute these myself. (in other words, stating the obvious to make sure I cover my ass for legal purposes here: the fact that I'm sharing screenshots with these logos and graphics in them in a CC-BY-SA-4.0 repository doesn't mean the license extends to those graphics)
