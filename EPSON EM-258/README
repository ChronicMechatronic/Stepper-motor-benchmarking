## EPSON EM-257 / EM-258



These apparently come as a pair in the old Epson Stylus inkjet printers. I was never lucky enough to disassemble one of these printers myself, but based on the gears and pulleys that were on the shaft when I got the motors, I'd think the EM-257 was driving the print head while the EM-258 was for the paper feed. Good times when even inkjet printers had NEMA 17s inside...
That said, despite the slightly different naming and physical appearance, from what I could see, both these steppers were customized versions of the same motor called 17PM-K212-PIT from Astrosyn at the time, so I simply lumped them together for testing.

There is some ambiguity about the rated current for this motor since the closest thing I found to a datasheet for the 17PM-K212-PIT mentioned 0.6A phase curent but the old website entry for the EM-258 stated 0.7A, which is what I ultimately went with.

That being said, here are links to everything I found about them on the web:

The random Google spreadsheet listing which printers these motors can be salvaged from: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TOAJp6hJdnVPc86Z5KwxvSGqu_2xwKQJDcFqrtlP1YU/htmlembed?single=true&gid=0&widget=false
The (extremely slow) old website stating the specs: http://www.motors.wrobots.com/EM-258_17PM-K212-PIT.php
And a sort of "datasheet" for the 17PM-K212-PIT: https://www.roboternetz.de/phpBB2/files/17pm-k212-p1t.pdf

There are also exported PDF versions for each of these sites as a backup in case any of them goes down in the future.
