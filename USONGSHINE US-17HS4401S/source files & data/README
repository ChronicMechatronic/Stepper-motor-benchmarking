The pictures starting with "IMG_20241223_[...]" are the completely unedited raw photos as I pulled them from the camera. 

The ones named just "USONGSHINE 17HS4401S" and then the drive voltage/current are straightened, cropped, and otherwise edited to make them more presentable.

"comparison sheet.svg" and "microstepping chart.odt" are the Inkscape and LibreOffice source documents I put the final microstepping data sheet together in, just in case you need to make some changes
(cause, well, I said it was open source)
